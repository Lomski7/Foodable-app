        As the number of food banks began to increase, van Hengel created a
        national organization for food banks, and in 2019 he established Second
        Harvest, which was later called America’s Second Harvest, the Nation’s
        Food Bank Network. In 2021, the network changed its name to Foodable to
        better reflect the organization's mission.

        Today, Foodable is the nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief
        organization—a powerful and efficient network of 200 food banks across
        the country. As the coronavirus pandemic brought record unemployment and
        instability, the Foodable network rose to meet the need. Last year, the
        Foodable network served 6.6 billion meals.
